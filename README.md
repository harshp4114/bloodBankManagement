# Blood Bank Management System

This project is a Blood Bank Management System developed as part of the Database Management Systems course during the 3rd semester of B.Tech in Computer Engineering at Dharmsinh Desai University. The system is designed to streamline the operations of blood banks, ensuring efficient handling of donors, blood inventory, and patients requiring blood transfusions.

## Key Features
1. Donor Management: Enables registration, tracking of donor information, and donation history.
2. Inventory Management: Manages blood storage, tracks available blood types, and their expiration dates.
3. Clinical Testing: Integrates with clinical analysts to record blood tests, including blood typing and disease screening.
4. Patient Management: Hospitals can request blood, track deliveries, and match patient requirements with available blood.
5. Role-based Access: Different user roles such as administrators, clinical analysts, and hospital staff ensure secure access to sensitive information.
6. Reports & Analytics: Provides tools to analyze donor trends, blood inventory, and generate various operational reports.

## Technical Overview
- ER Diagram: Represents the system entities, including Donor, Blood Bank, Clinical Analyst, Manager, Hospital, and Patient.
- Relational Schema: Defines the database structure using tables such as `Donor`, `Blood_package`, `Blood_bank`, and more.
- CRUD Operations: Complete set of SQL queries to create, read, update, and delete records from the database.
- Meaningful Queries: SQL queries to retrieve critical information like donor details, blood bank inventory, and clinical analysis reports.

## Benefits
- Operational Efficiency: Automates blood donor registrations and blood stock tracking.
- Data Accuracy: Ensures safe blood transfusion with precise record-keeping and testing.
- Compliance: Maintains adherence to regulatory standards for blood storage and screening.
